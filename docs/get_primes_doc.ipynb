    "Project Euler's 10th problem states: \"Find the sum of all the primes below two million\". Using our \"get_primes()\" function trivializes this solution, as we can simply use Python's built-in \"sum()\" function with our function while passing 2,000,000 as the argument. Our function will retrieve the list of all primes under 2,000,000 and \"sum()\" will calculate thier sum to reach the answer."

    "The get_primes() function uses a custom Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to retrieve the list of prime numbers. It does this by initializing a list of all number under n, then it iterates through all of them from the bottom to the top and assigns their multiples as non-primes. Once done, it leaves you with a list containing only prime numbers under n. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log(log(n))) and a space complexity of O(n)."
