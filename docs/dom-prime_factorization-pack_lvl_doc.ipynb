    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **`n`**: An integer to factorize. Must be a positive integer greater than 1.\n",

    "### Returns\n",
    "- **List of Tuples**: Each tuple contains a prime factor and its power.\n",

    "### Raises\n",
    "- **`ValueError`**: If the input `n` is not a positive integer greater than 1.\n",

    "- Uses trial division for factorization.\n",
    "- For large `n`, optimized algorithms like Pollard's Rho or the Quadratic Sieve are recommended. -->"

    "A cybersecurity researcher is investigating the factorization of large integers as part of a study on cryptographic algorithms, specifically RSA encryption. The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. To demonstrate this concept, the researcher uses the prime_factorization function to:  \n",
    "  1.\tFactorize smaller integers to explain the concept of prime factorization to a team of non-technical stakeholders.  \n",
    "  2.\tTest and validate a set of randomly generated composite numbers to confirm their factorization as part of the cryptographic key analysis process.  \n",
